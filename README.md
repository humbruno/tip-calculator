## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Gulp workflow

### What I learned

Quite a challenging one! The math formula side of things was a bit of a headache, but I definitely struggled the most with switching active states between buttons, and updating the total amounts on the right side as the inputs are changed!

I feel proud of the end result but definitely feel that my JavaScript could be a bit more compact and separated into more reusable components, something to keep in mind for next project!
